## Abstract
This report is prepared for the final assignment of the Overview of Natural Language Processing course at the University of Cambridge. For this assignment, I built an abstractive summarization system using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture. I trained and evaluated this model on different subsets of the CNN/DailyMail dataset. Additionally, I compared the performance of this
system with extractive approaches.
